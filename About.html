    <article>
        <p>Hi there! I'm <strong>Akshat Neeraj</strong>, a BCA student at Lovely Professional University. I'm still getting used to the whole university life, and I have to admit that I'm a bit of a blank slate when it comes to most things. I mean, I've always been interested in technology and computing, but my knowledge of programming, coding, and software development is basically non-existent.</p>
        <p>Despite this, I'm determined to learn and make the most of my time here. I know that the BCA program is challenging, but I'm excited to take on the challenge and see how far I can go. I'm willing to put in the hard work and effort required to succeed, and I'm hoping that my enthusiasm and eagerness to learn will make up for my lack of knowledge.</p>
        <p>As a student, I'm looking forward to learning new skills and concepts, and I'm hoping to gain a solid foundation in programming and computer science. I'm also excited to work on projects that will allow me to apply what I've learned in real-world scenarios, and I'm hoping to make connections with my peers and professors who can help me grow as a student and a professional.</p>
        <p>Outside of academics, I enjoy spending time with friends and family, watching movies, playing video games, and trying out new foods. I'm also a bit of a music enthusiast, and I love listening to indie rock and electronic music.</p>
        <p>I know that it won't be easy, but I'm willing to put in the effort required to achieve my goals.</p>
